Objective Function : A measure of fitness for each gene, also the goal of the algorithm
	- The OF should be minimized or maximized depending on the problem
	- Some real world OFs can be very difficult to optimize, thus we need GAs
	- Can work with binary, floating point, integers, strings

Gene : A pair of [chromosome, fitness]
	- Chromosome is a list of True/False values (i.e. binary) that can be converted to the required format using a decode function
	- Based on human/animal genetics; many binary traits, each of which are either active or inactive (True/False)

Fitness : The measure of how good a given gene is, found by using an Objective Function on the chromosome of the gene

Generation : The current population within the genetic algorithm
	- The first generation is created randomly
	- Each subsequent generation is based on the best genes of the previous one, as well as some of the worse genes
	- fitness of a gene determines whether it is able to move to the next generation

Population : A list of genes, size of population is decided by user
	- More genes => more variety
	- Less genes => more control (less possible combinations when performing crossover)

selection : The process of choosing a gene from the population, genes with better fitness have higher chance of being selected
	- By giving high fitness genes higher chance of being selected, the best genes are more likely to carry over to the next generation
	- We want the best genes to "survive" the longest, and the worst genes to die off as early as possible

crossover : Combines two genes to create two new genes
	- Two genes are selected
	- Controlled by probability, genes are crossed randomly based on a given probability
	- First X True/False values of gene1 are swapped with first X values of gene2 in hopes of improving the genes

mutation : Flips a single bit in a given gene in hopes of improvement
	- Controlled by probability, gene mutated randomly based on a given probability

statistics : general and useful information about the current population of genes
	- statistics are updated after each generation is created
	- Updated the best gene, finds sum of all gene fitnesses, etc.



VARIABLES (in our SGA implementation):

maxgen  : maximum number of generations to calculate before finishing
lchrom  : length of each chromosome, changes based on what you want to do (and the OF you are trying to optimize)
popsize : number of genes in the population, this number stays constant throughout all generations
pmutate : probability of mutating a gene, constant throughout the SGA, however more complicated GAs may change this values
pcross  : probability of crossover of two genes, same as pmutate for SGA
sumfit  : the sum of all fitness values in a given generation, useful for gene selection
best    : the best gene so far over all population, can be minimum or maximum depending on goal
pop     : the current population (list of genes)
